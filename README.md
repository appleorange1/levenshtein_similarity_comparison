# bitwise_similarity_comparison
Calculates the similarity of two files based on bitwise comparision

Returns the number of matching bits found and the number of differing bits
found.

If the two files are of different length, the files are only compared up to
the length of the shortest file.

NOTE: This repository was previously incorrectly named
levenshtein_similarity_comparison. This is incorrect, since I misremembered the
definition of the Levenshtein distance when writing this module. Please ignore
any remaining references to this.
